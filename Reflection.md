#IMM280-02

**1. Organization: How did this way of organizing and completing a project differ from how you typically organize and complete a project?**

I have a few code folders where I save *everything* of a specific language. All of my c++, java, and web stuff lived in little boxes and did not touch each other or see the light of day. Having a github where everything can be uploaded and backed-up online is really new and exciting for me. Going forward, I definitely would like to try organizing my projects to include specific checkpoints where I should commit. As you can see for this project, I chose to commit 'often' and labled the very specific, not-always-importaint things I was struggling with, and that doesn't seem like a very sustainable plan for the future. 

**2. Assessment: In what was was this an improvement, and in what ways was it not? Was the additional effort worth it, and do you see it worth using in the future?**

I had never been able to so easily go back to different versions of my project - having them labled and ordered was amazing, especially as I struggled with this project. I usually keep several saved versions of one thing (project1attempt2, project1attempt... project1attempt96) for when I try new things to fix a problem, but that is not very descriptive. This eliminated a lot of frustration I had after I broke my code. The only downside is that now I know how to use Github desktop, I do not think I'll be going back to the terminal in a hurry. 

The additional effort was definitely worth it for this project, but I don't think github will be worth it for me for small labs or simple code. I'm already planning on using github for future work, just maybe not something with less than 100 lines of code. 

**3. Reflection: Even if you donâ€™t use git or Github on future projects, how has this process changed how you might work on future projects? Also, please sum up what you learned in this mini-course.**

Branches, their proper use, and their destruction, are definitely things I am going to continue to look into as I use github. I like the control and freedom it gives me to expiriment and try new things. 

This course taught me how to use github at the terminal level, but it also showed me a way that I feel comfortable using on a regular basis. It also provided a large amount of resources for me to use going forward, which I really appreicate.
